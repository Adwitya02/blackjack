## How to Play
Once you run the game, you'll be asked for your name. After that, the game deals two cards to you and two to the dealer (but only one of theirs is shown at first).
You can choose to:
- `H` (Hit) – Take another card.
- `S` (Stand) – End your turn and let the dealer play.
- `R` (Reshuffle) – Shuffle the deck (you keep your current hand).
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If you bust (go over 21), the dealer wins. If not, the dealer takes their turn and whoever has the higher hand value (without going over) wins.

### How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. Download and unzip the project.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
4. Run the game from main.py
